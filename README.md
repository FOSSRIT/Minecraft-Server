Open source Minecraft server used to teach K-12 kids and teens about FOSS


## What

The [FOSS@MAGIC](http://foss.rit.edu) Minecraft server is an open source Minecraft server that is intended to be used as a teaching utility for children, teens, and young adults in the K-12 range. The server's files, configurations, and data are all open source in this repository for modification. Anyone is allowed to submit pull requests to the server, fork the server and start their own, and/or make modifications and distribute them.
