## Getting started

After clocking in and entering the working space, do the following tasks:

1. Open a new browser window and open the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/GOAlCZ40), [GitHub repo](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/Minecraft-Server), and [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rit-minecraft).
2. Start a meeting with the Meetbot bot (currently `Fanshawe`) in [`#rit-minecraft`](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rit-minecraft) on the [freenode](https://freenode.net/) IRC network. To start a meeting, you need to run the following commands.
 * `#startmeeting Minecraft Game Research Work Session - $DATE`

  * This section will have a brief overview of what I want to accomplish this work session
 * `#topic $NEXT_THING`
