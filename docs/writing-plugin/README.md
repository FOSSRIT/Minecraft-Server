Writing a plugin for the server
===============================

After a while, you may decide that playing on the server, changing configurations, and adding plugins isn't enough. Maybe you have an idea for a super cool and awesome plugin of your own. Writing a plugin will require some programming skills. If you've programmed before, you may find it easy. If not, be prepared to be patient and work on building your own skills to write a plugin of your own.


## Rules for your plugin

If you want the plugin added to the server, keep these rules and requirements in mind.

1. Your plugin must be open source (preferably on GitHub).
2. Your plugin must have an OSI-approved license.

While your plugin doesn't have to be open source, it will have to be open source and licensed if you wish to use it in the official RIT server.


## Getting started

Before getting started with writing your own plugin, you will need to do a few things before writing the actual code. You will need to make your workspace, get the resources for learning, and know where to reach out for support and help.

### Building your workspace

Your workspace is one of the most important parts of getting started. Your development environment will need to be set up so you can program in the Java programming language. There is a useful [guide](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_Up_Your_Workspace) on the Bukkit Wiki, but some of that page's contents will be listed here.

**What you need**:

1. [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (latest version is for Java 8 - use that!)
2. [git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
4. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
 1. [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) (free and open source)
 2. [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org/) (free and open source)
 3. [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (free but not open source)

These are the minimum amount of things you will need to get started. You can have more things, though, like the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app.

### Resources

There are plenty of online resources available for learning how to create Bukkit/Spigot plugins. There is an [in-depth tutorial](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Plugin_Tutorial) on the Bukkit Wiki. You will also receive assistance and help from instructors for this lesson.

If you're just getting started with programming, it's important to have some background knowledge of the Java programming language. There are [official tutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) offered by Oracle. There's also an excellent series by YouTuber _TheNewBoston_ in a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28). Taking the time to understand the basic concepts will save you a lot of time and frustration later.
